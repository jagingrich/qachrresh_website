Title: Archaeology at Qach Rresh: Interactive Plan

The Rural Landscapes of Iron Age Imperial Mesopotamia project (RLIIM) seeks to understand how imperial polities of ancient Mesopotamia interacted with the landscape via policies of resource extraction, population resettlement, and centralized infrastructure.  So far, the rural hinterlands of the Assyrian Empire have remained largely under-investigated, but have much to reveal about the relationship between Assyrian imperial structure and organic bottom-up growth.

Subheader: The 2022 Season

With a season lasting 5 weeks (from August 31 â€“ October 2, 2022) the RLIIM team opened two trenches over the main building remains at Qach Rresh.

Both the buildings in Operation A and Operation B were difficult to identify based on excavation alone, due to significant deterioration in the mudbrick. By using the magnetometry data together with the excavation, we were able to come to several conclusions about the site after one season:
(1) While we believe the buildings to have been constructed in the Neo-Assyrian period, many of the artifacts collected from the Qach Rresh excavations likely date to the post-Assyrian phase of the Iron Age (c. 600-500 BCE). This conclusion is based on the post-Assyrian forms of the ceramics and the common use of grit instead of chaff as a temper.
(2) The rooms of Building B (in Operation B) were used as a dump in the post-Assyrian period.
