Title: Operation B

Subheader: The 2022 Season
The room excavated in Building B (Op. B) this season contained at least 130cm of fill from trash deposition. Below these multiple deposition events (which can be identified in the stratigraphy of the baulk) there was what appeared to be roughly 55cm of mudbrick collapse, likely from the roof of the building. Below this, there was a 30cm thick layer of hard-packed clay with very few artifacts. We interpret this layer to be the remains of the foundation trench constructed before Building B was built.

While initially we approached Qach Rresh believing it to be occupied only in the late Neo-Assyrian period (c. 750-600 BCE) we now recognize that it was also used in the post-Assyrian period.  The buildings may have been constructed in the Neo-Assyrian period, abandoned, and then reused in the post-Assyrian period, based on preliminary interpretations of the ceramic material.  Overall, we are also interested in the potential to investigate the post-Assyrian occupation of the Erbil Plain, considering it has been largely underrepresented in archaeological studies.
