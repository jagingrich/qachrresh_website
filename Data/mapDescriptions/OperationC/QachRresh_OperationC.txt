Title: Operation C

Subheader: The 2023 Season

Operation C was started on May 28 2023 with the intention to investigate a small area of one of the new buildings to the south identified in the magnetometry.  We laid out a 4x2m trench to test the contents of one of the rooms (see Fig. 17).  Kak Ahmed Jodat was the trench leader of Op. C.  In five days of excavation, we reached a depth of 1.53 m.

The room which Operation C intersects, as its magnetic signature indicated, was used as a trash deposition area after its main use (likely during the Assyrian imperial period).  We discovered a single wall running NNE-SSW protruding roughly one meter into the trenchâ€™s eastern side with several of its mudbricks able to be defined.  These measured roughly 34x34cm, equivalent to those in Operation B. This is likely the dividing wall between rooms, as can be seen in Fig. 7.

There were several layers of ash deposit and mudbrick collapse, followed by trash deposition which yielded a high number of sherds and faunal remains.  Unlike the trash deposition event layers in Operation B which can be quite thin (possibly indicating individual household trash deposits), the ashy layers and trash layers in Op. C were quite thick (roughly 8-10cm thick on average) and might indicate larger amounts of refuse being deposited in these southern buildings at one time.  All trash layers slope down from the preserved wall, which may indicate that this wall had already deteriorated by the time the rooms were used as dumps.
