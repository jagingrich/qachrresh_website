Title: Operation A

Subheader: The 2022 Season

In Operation A we excavated down in 20cm intervals with the intention of uncovering a large set of walls bounding the northwestern part of the courtyard in the main building identified through magnetometry.  At a depth of around 50cm, the texture of the soil matrix began to harden, becoming thick and difficult to excavate.  While the walls were difficult to identify due to this uniform matrix, we were able to distinguish the wall (A-013) running roughly from NW-SE based on a pit that had been cut into the fill of the building.  The pit itself was filled with ash, charcoal, animal bone, and broken pottery.

It quickly became evident that the western half of the trench was very similar in soil type to much of Op. A, where calcium carbonate crystals were intermingled with dark brown, thick soil.  In the eastern half of the trench, however, we began to collect large amounts of sherds and animal bones beginning at a depth of 35cm.  To focus our efforts, we separated the trench in half and continued to excavate in the eastern half, while also opening a 4x5m area in the northeastern corner of the trench.  Based on soil color and texture, we were able to estimate the orientation and thickness of the mudbrick wall bounding the room on its western side.  We designated this wall before continuing to excavate the roomâ€™s fill.
